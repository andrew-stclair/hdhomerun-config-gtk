Description: Configure and preview HDHomeRun TV tuners
 HDHomeRun Config is a GNOME application for configuring and previewing
 HDHomeRun network TV tuners. It provides an intuitive interface to
 automatically discover HDHomeRun devices on your network, preview live TV
 from tuners, scan for channels, manage saved channels, and manually tune
 to specific frequencies.
 .
 The application is built with GTK4 and libadwaita, providing a modern
 interface that works great on both desktop and mobile devices.
